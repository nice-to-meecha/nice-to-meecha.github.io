                    I've found that I truly enjoy finding different furniture pieces and
                    arranging them within a space. It's fascinating to see how much one
                    simple room can change, based on the elements you've added to it.

                    when I had some spare time.

                <h4>Webcomics</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the things I love to do most is read webcomics. There are so many
                    worlds that just come alive with words and still images. With webcomics,
                    you get a much more vivid picture of what the author had in mind, yet you
                    also still get to imagine what happens between panels, what the characters
                    sounds like, and a variety of other things. It truly offers a unique experience
                    that I haven't yet found anywhere else.

                    I'm currently reading "Operation: True Love". I usually like traditional rom-coms, but this
                    one has so much drama I hadn't anticipated, that I can't seem to put it down, at times.
                    I guess I really like drama. ðŸ˜…

                <h4>3D Modeling</h4>
                <p>
                    I love the idea of crafting beautiful things -- whether physical or digital --
                    with my own two hands. (Unfortunately, this website didn't quite make the cut. ðŸ¥²) 
                    I think 3D models can be absolutely breath-taking, and I aspire to create an
                    animated short that gives any viewers that same feeling.

                    This image comes from a digital short I've enjoyed watching.
                    It's called La Noria by Carlos Baena.
