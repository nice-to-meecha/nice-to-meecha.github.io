# Project 1 Write-Up

A writeup responding to the following questions and ideas(at least 3
sentences per bullet point):

1. What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find
   it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this
   overall assignment take you?
   
   Trying to determine the layout for everything took the most time.
   I spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out how to resize
   grid rows, upon hovering its child elements, only to realize that
   I would be better served by utilizing a flex column instead.
   
   I found it especially challenging to work with CSS. I encountered
   so many problems with positioning and resizing items, that I ended
   up turning this in an entire 3 days late. I stopped counting the
   hours after a while, but I would say that I likely spent anywhere in
   between 34 and 40 hours on this website. Unfortunately, it only
   looks like a spent a few minutes on it.

2. What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

   I changes the font and image sizes with @media queries. Apart from
   that, I also ensured that most of them (I'm sure I missed some) were
   using percentage or view-width sizes, so that they would adjust with
   the picture size. I also changed the layout of the grid on the Hobbies
   page, as well as the Experience and Education sections on the Home page,
   in order to account for long, mobile screens.

3. What did you take into account when you developed the *design* of your
   website?  Is there anything that you’re particularly proud of?

   I took into account the layout of current, modern sites and tried
   incorporating some of those designs into my own site. I'm not
   particularly proud of anything. This portfolio is honestly horrible, but
   I guess the vertical Technical Knowledge section might be the most visually
   interesting. I don't know.

4. Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add
   to your site in the future? 

   I would've added more animations, since this website is currently pretty
   boring. I also would've resized the contact table, so that it would actually
   be more mobile friendly, as it currently is not. I also would have added
   some JavaScript, so that I could enable animations upon scrolling, since
   those are pretty popular these days (I think).

5. How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
   I would say it took approximately 34-40 hours to complete this assignment.
   I'm not sure of how else to say this, such that it would take at least 3 sentences.
   I am so tired.
